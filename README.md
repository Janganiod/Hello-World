# Hello-World
Introduction to creating a a Github repository for the first time under this account.
Hello world, my name is Jenoye Stewart, an aspiring young web and computer programmer. I started my coding journey last year, and find it exhilarating. I am compelled and challenged each day by what I don't know and the endless possibilies of programming. I am currently only focused on we development, but i have a desire to become proficiently in mobile development and creating software and operating systems. I am a family person with one daughter. I would love to meet other developer from around the world to mentor me on my journey, as i am self taught up to this point.
